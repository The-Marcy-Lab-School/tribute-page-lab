        <strong> 1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong> 1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
